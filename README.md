puppet-modules
==============

Collection of some pupput modules I've been working on.

# Setup

Start by running the puppet installation script that matches your disto.

Once puppet is installed you will need enter the puppet directory and run as root:

`puppet apply --modulepath modules manifests/init.pp`

After puppet has completed you should have an adequate development environemnt ready
to go!
